# Day 8 — SQL Thinking (Hard Mode)

Focus:
- Understanding SQL logic before execution
- Converting English questions into SQL queries

Key Concepts Practiced:
- SELECT → choose columns
- WHERE → filter rows
- AND / OR → logical conditions
- ORDER BY → sorting
- LIMIT → controlling output

No database execution was done on Day 8.
The goal was to build strong SQL thinking before using PostgreSQL.
