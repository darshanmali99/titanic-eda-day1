📊 Data Analysis Learning Journey — By Darshan Mali

This repository documents my structured journey to become a Data Analyst, 
focusing on Python, data handling, analysis, and real-world problem solving.

--------------------------------------------------

📌 Day 1 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Dataset: Titanic Dataset

Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Key Work:
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Gender distribution analysis
- Passenger class analysis
- Survival analysis by gender
- Data visualization using Seaborn

Key Insight:
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males
- Clear impact of passenger class and gender on survival

--------------------------------------------------

📌 Day 2 — Python Fundamentals for Data Analysis

Focus:
Building strong Python foundations required for data analysis.

Concepts Covered:
- Variables and data types
- Conditional logic (if–else)
- Loops (for)
- Functions
- Dictionaries and lists
- Real-world logic building
- Converting Python data into Pandas DataFrames
- Filtering data using conditions

Mini Project:
- Student eligibility & result evaluation system
- Classified students as Adult/Minor and Pass/Fail
- Converted results into a structured DataFrame
- Applied conditional filtering using Pandas

--------------------------------------------------

🎯 Goal:
To build strong fundamentals, complete real-world projects, participate in competitions, 
and prepare for Data Analyst internships and roles in top companies.
