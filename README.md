📊 Titanic Dataset EDA — Day 1
By Darshan Mali

This project is part of my Data Analysis learning journey.
On Day-1, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

🔍 Key Insights
1️⃣ Gender Distribution

Male: 577

Female: 314

2️⃣ Passenger Class Distribution

Most passengers traveled in 3rd class.

3️⃣ Age Distribution

Majority were between 20–35 years old.

4️⃣ Survival by Gender (Most Important Insight)

A large number of male passengers did not survive

A high proportion of female passengers survived

This strongly reflects the evacuation rule:
👉 "Women and children first."
