📊 Data Analysis Learning Journey — Darshan Mali

This repository documents my structured, hands-on journey toward becoming a Data Analyst, with a strong focus on Python, Pandas, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and analytical thinking.

Rather than only learning tools, the goal of this journey is to develop the ability to:

Ask the right questions from data

Validate assumptions

Avoid misleading conclusions

Translate numbers into business-relevant insights

🎯 Learning Philosophy

Data analysis is not about writing more code,
but about thinking clearly, logically, and responsibly with data.

Each day in this repository reflects progressive learning, real-world datasets, and analyst-style reasoning.

📅 Progress Overview
✅ Day 1 — Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)

Focus: Understanding a dataset before drawing conclusions

Skills Practiced

Data loading and initial inspection

Identifying missing values

Frequency analysis and distributions

Basic visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn

Key Insights

Gender-based survival differences

Passenger class distribution

Age trends affecting survival

Concepts Covered

Variables and data types

Conditional logic (if / else)

Loops (for)

Functions

Lists and dictionaries

Outcome

Developed problem-solving logic using real-world student data examples

Focused on clarity and reasoning rather than syntax memorization

✅ Day 3 — Pandas Core Operations

Focus: Converting business questions into data queries

Pandas Skills

Creating and manipulating DataFrames

Column selection and filtering

Sorting and ranking

Aggregations (mean, min, max, count)

Key Learning

Shifted mindset from “writing code” to answering questions with data

✅ Day 4–6 — Student Dataset: EDA, Cleaning & Analytical Thinking

(Single notebook to reflect real analyst workflow)

🔹 Day 4 — Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Handling missing values responsibly

Understanding data structure and data types

Standardizing categorical values

Creating meaningful features

Validating cleaned datasets

🔹 Day 5 — Exploratory Data Analysis & Insight Extraction

Univariate analysis

Categorical data analysis

Bivariate analysis

Insight-driven visual exploration

Identifying academic performance patterns

🔹 Day 6 — Deep EDA Thinking & Avoiding Wrong Conclusions

Importance of segmentation before conclusions

Mean vs median (why averages can mislead)

Correlation vs causation

Understanding Simpson’s Paradox

Translating findings into business-style reasoning

Key Learning
Learned how professional analysts avoid incorrect conclusions by validating insights, questioning averages, and analyzing data in meaningful segments.

Matplotlib / Seaborn (where applicable)

## Day 8–9: SQL for Data Analysis

- Learned SQL fundamentals with analyst mindset
- Practiced SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT
- Executed real SQL queries using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin
- Created database, table, and inserted data
- Used GROUP BY with aggregates like AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX
- Combined WHERE with GROUP BY for filtered analysis

Tools:
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin 4

📅 Day 10 — Business-Focused SQL Analysis
Overview

Performed a business-oriented SQL analysis to evaluate performance patterns and identify high-performing and at-risk individuals using structured queries.

Key Questions Answered

Performance distribution across rating categories

Relationship between attendance and performance

Identification of top performers

Detection of at-risk individuals

SQL Skills Used

SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY

Logical conditions (AND, OR)

Group-based analysis

Priority-based ranking

Key Outcome

SQL was used as a decision-support tool to highlight performance trends and enable targeted intervention strategies.
