Skills Practiced

Data loading & inspection

Handling missing values

Value counts & distributions

Basic visualizations (Seaborn & Matplotlib)

Key Insights

Gender-based survival differences

Passenger class distribution

Age trends in survival

✅ Day 2 — Python Fundamentals for Data Analysis

Concepts Covered

Variables & data types

Conditional logic (if / else)

Loops (for)

Functions

Dictionaries & lists

Real-world student data logic (Adult / Pass status)

Outcome

Built logic like a data analyst, not just a coder

✅ Day 3 — Pandas Core Operations

Pandas Skills

Creating DataFrames

Column selection

Filtering with conditions

Sorting & ranking

Aggregations (mean, min, max)

Analyst-style queries (multi-condition filters)

Focus

Thinking in terms of business questions

Translating logic → data insights

📁 Notebook: day3_pandas_fundamentals.ipynb

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

🎯 Goal

To build a strong data analyst profile with:

Consistent daily learning

Clean GitHub documentation

Real-world analytical thinking

Internship-ready skills

📅Day 4 — Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

On Day 4, I focused on one of the most important and practical skills for a Data Analyst: cleaning messy data and preparing it for analysis.

🔧 Topics Covered

Handling missing values (isnull(), sum(), fillna())

Understanding data structure using info() and dtypes

Fixing incorrect data types (e.g., float → int)

Standardizing categorical values (e.g., Nashik vs nashik)

Removing or correcting inconsistent entries

Statistical overview using describe()

Validating cleaned data before analysis

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook

📌 Key Learning Outcome

Learned how real-world datasets are rarely clean and how systematic data cleaning improves data quality, accuracy, and reliability before analysis or modeling.
