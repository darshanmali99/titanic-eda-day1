# 📊 Data Analysis Learning Journey — Darshan Mali

This repository documents my structured, day-by-day journey to become a Data Analyst, focusing on Python, Pandas, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and analytical thinking.

The goal is not just to learn tools, but to develop strong data-driven reasoning and business-oriented insights.

## 📅 Progress Overview

### ✅ Day 1 — Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)
**Focus:** Understanding data through basic EDA

**Skills Practiced**
- Data loading & inspection
- Handling missing values
- Value counts & distributions
- Basic visualizations (Matplotlib & Seaborn)

**Key Insights**
- Gender-based survival differences
- Passenger class distribution
- Age trends in survival

### ✅ Day 2 — Python Fundamentals for Data Analysis
**Focus:** Building logic required for analytical problem-solving

**Concepts Covered**
- Variables & data types
- Conditional logic (if / else)
- Loops (for)
- Functions
- Lists & dictionaries

**Outcome**
- Developed analyst-style logic using real-world student data examples

### ✅ Day 3 — Pandas Core Operations
**Focus:** Translating business questions into data queries

**Pandas Skills**
- Creating DataFrames
- Column selection
- Filtering with conditions
- Sorting & ranking
- Aggregations (mean, min, max)

**Key Learning**
- Thinking in terms of questions, not just code

### ✅ Day 4–6 — Student Dataset: EDA, Cleaning & Analytical Thinking
*(Single notebook to reflect real analyst workflow)*

#### 🔹 Day 4 — Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Handling missing values
- Understanding data types and structure
- Standardizing categorical values
- Creating meaningful features
- Validating cleaned data

#### 🔹 Day 5 — Exploratory Data Analysis & Insight Extraction
- Univariate analysis
- Categorical analysis
- Bivariate analysis
- Insight-driven visualizations
- Identifying performance patterns

#### 🔹 Day 6 — Deep EDA Thinking & Avoiding Wrong Conclusions
- Segmentation before conclusion
- Mean vs median (why averages mislead)
- Correlation vs causation
- Simpson’s Paradox
- Business-style reasoning from data

**Key Learning**
Learned how analysts prevent wrong conclusions by breaking data into meaningful segments and validating insights logically.
